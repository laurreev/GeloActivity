            <h2>AUTOCLAVED AERATED CONCRETE</h2>

           <center><img src="resources/image01.jfif" alt=""></center> 

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is concrete that has been manufactured to contain closed air pockets. AAC is one-fifth the weight of concrete. AAC is available as panels and blocks. AAC wall panels are typically used for cladding, but can also be loadbearing. AAC floor and roof panels are also available. Aerated lightweight concrete have many advantages when compared with conventional concrete such as advanced strength to weight ratio, lower coefficient of thermal expansion, and good sound insulation as a result of air voids within aerated concrete.</p>
            
            <center><img src="resources/image02.jfif" alt=""></center>

            <h3>History of AAC</h3>
            <p>Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) turned into first produced in Sweden inside the Nineteen Thirties and also can be referred to as mobile foamed concrete. Early history of autoclaved aerated concrete is based on a series of process patents. In 1880 a German researcher Michaelis was granted a patent on his steam curing processes. Czech Hoffman successfully tested and patented in 1889 the method of “aerating” the concrete by carbon dioxide. Americans Aylsworth and Dyer used aluminium powder and calcium hydroxide to attain porous cementitious mixture for which they also received a patent in 1914. Swede Axel Eriksson made a serious next step towards developing modern AAC when in 1920 he patented the methods of making aerated mix of limestone and ground slate (a so-called “lime formula”).</p>

            <h3>AAC Compounds</h3>
            <p>AAC is the use of no aggregate is larger than sand. AAC is the aggregate of cement, sand, water, gypsum, lime and aluminium powder. The chemical response of aluminium paste makes it a porous shape having mild weight and greater insulation houses making one-of-a-kind from different mild weight concrete. The powdered zinc can also be delivered in area of aluminium powder. The silica flume is used as additive materials in concrete mortar and cement. AAC consists of cementations mortar surrounding disconnected air voids and microscopic bubbles where in the air bubbles have been, are the consequences of gas formed inside the mortar. Improving homes of creation subs. Today aerated concrete is produced through cement is created by numerous organizations, especially in Europe and Asia. There is some generation in the Americas and in Africa, there is one plant in Egypt. AAC creation in Europe has backed off extensively, yet the business is developing quickly in Asia because of solid interest in lodging and business space. China is presently the biggest aircraft showcase on the planet with a few hundred manufacturing plants. China, Focal Asia, India, and the central East are the greatest regarding AAC assembling and utilization with the herbal volcanic materials have come to be massive and their use as creation substances can lead to enhanced performance of AAC.</p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>The Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is light-hued and contains numerous small voids that can be observed when taken a gander at intently. The gas used to 'froth' the solid during the manufacturing process is hydrogen from the chemical reaction from the Aluminum paste with alkaline soluble components in the cement concrete. These air pockets add to the material's protecting properties. In contrast to stonework, there is no immediate way for water to go through the material; be that as it may, it can suck up dampness and a suitable covering is required to forestall water infiltration. </p>

            <h3>Structural capability </h3>
            <p>The compressive quality of Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) blocks is excellent. The compressive quality is from 35 to 50 kg/cm2 (according to IS: 2185). Although it is one-fifth the thickness of typical solid it despite everything has a large portion of the bearing quality, and loadbearing structures up to three stories high can be securely raised with AAC blockwork. The AAC is 3-4 times lighter than traditional bricks, therefore, easier and cheaper to transport. Usage reduces the overall dead load of a building, thereby allowing the construction of taller buildings. Entire building structures can be made in AAC from walls to floors and roofing with reinforced lintels, blocks, and floor, wall and roofing panels available from the manufacturer. AAC floor panels can be used to make non-loadbearing concrete floors that can be installed by carpenters. Lightweight blocks diminish the mass of a structure, along these lines diminishing the effect of tremor on a structure.</p>

            <h3>Thermal mass</h3>
            <p>The thermal mass performance of Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is dependent on the climate in which it is used. With its mixture of concrete and air pockets, AAC has a moderate overall level of thermal mass performance. Its use for internal walls and flooring can provide significant thermal mass. The temperature moderating thermal mass is most useful in climates with high cooling needs.</p>

            <h3>Sound insulation</h3>
            <p>With its closed air pockets, Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) can provide very good sound insulation. It has superior sound absorption qualities due to the porous structure of blocks. Combining the AAC wall with an insulated asymmetric air cavity system gives a wall excellent sound insulation property. AAC offers sound attenuation of about 42 dB, blocking out all major sounds and disturbances. The Sound Reduction Index is 45 dB for 200 mm thick block walls (against 50 for 230 mm thick wall). It is ideal for schools, hospitals, hotels, offices, multi-family housing, and other structures that require acoustic insulation. </p>

            <h3>Fire and vermin resistance</h3>
            <p>Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is inorganic, incombustible and does not explode; it is thus well suited for fire-rated applications. Depending on the application and the thickness of the blocks or panels, fire ratings up to four hours can be achieved. AAC is non-combustible and fire-resistant up to 1600° C. It can withstand up to 6 hours of direct exposure. Due to the structure of blocks, AAC cannot be damaged or infested by termites and other pests. It does not attract rodents or other pests nor can it be damaged by such.</p>

            <h3>Durability and moisture resistance</h3>
            <p>The purposely lightweight nature of Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) makes it prone to impact damage. With the surface protected to resist moisture penetration, it is not affected by harsh climatic conditions and does not degrade under normal atmospheric conditions. The level of maintenance required by the material varies with the type of finish applied. The porous nature of AAC can allow moisture to penetrate to depth but the appropriate design (damp proof course layers and appropriate coating systems) prevents this happening. AAC does not easily degrade structurally when exposed to moisture, but its thermal performance may suffer. Several proprietary finishes (including acrylic polymer-based texture coatings) give durable and water-resistant coatings to AAC blockwork and panels. They need to be treated similarly with acrylic polymer-based coatings before tiling in wet areas such as showers. </p>

            <h3>Toxicity and Breathability</h3>
            <p> The aerated nature of AAC facilitates breathability. There are no toxic substances and no odor in the final product. However, AAC is a concrete product and calls for precautions similar to those for handling and cutting concrete products. It is advisable to wear personal protective equipment such as gloves, eyewear, and respiratory masks during cutting, due to the fine dust produced by concrete products. If low-toxic, vapor-permeable coatings are used on the walls, and care is taken not to trap moisture where it can condense, AAC may be an ideal material for homes for the chemically sensitive.</p>

            <h3>Constructability, Availability, and Cost </h3>
            <p>Although AAC is relatively easy to work, it is one-fifth the weight of concrete comes in a variety of sizes and is easily carved, cut and sculpted, it nevertheless requires careful and accurate placement: skilled trades and good supervision are essential. Different sizes of blocks help reduce the number of joints in wall masonry. Lighter blocks make construction easier and faster. It reduces construction time by 20%. They are easy to install. AAC sets and hardens quickly. Blocks can be easily cut, drilled, nailed, milled, and grooved to fit individual requirements. Thick-bed mortar is more forgiving but is uncommon and not the industry preferred option. It also simplifies hydro-sanitary and electrical installations, such as pipes or ducts, which can be installed after the main construction is complete. The construction process with AAC produces little waste as blockwork offcuts can be reused in wall construction.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) is a novel and one of the most suitable and sustainable building materials in the present building construction industry. AAC blocks are a result of productive use of recycled industrial waste i.e. fly ash, hence this material can be classified as a sustainable building material mild weight concrete.</p>
