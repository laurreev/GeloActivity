            <h3>What is Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC)?</h3>
            <p>AAC is a lightweight, precast concrete material made from a mixture of sand, cement, lime, water, and an expanding agent that creates air pockets within the material. It is cured under high pressure and temperature in an autoclave.</p><br><br>

            <h3>What are the main ingredients of AAC?</h3>
            <p>The main ingredients of AAC include cement, lime, sand, water, and an expanding agent (usually aluminum powder) that helps in creating air bubbles within the mixture.</p><br><br>

            <h3>What is the primary advantage of AAC over traditional concrete? </h3>
            <p>The primary advantage of AAC is its lightweight nature, which reduces structural load, improves insulation properties, and makes it easier to handle and install compared to traditional concrete.</p><br><br>

            <h3>How is AAC cured?</h3>
            <p>AAC is cured in an autoclave under high temperature (about 180°C) and pressure. This process accelerates the chemical reaction between lime, silica, and the aluminum powder, leading to the formation of air pockets.</p><br><br>

            <h3>What are the thermal properties of AAC?</h3>
            <p>AAC has excellent thermal insulation properties, making it energy-efficient. It helps maintain indoor temperature, reducing heating and cooling costs in buildings.</p><br><br>

            <h3>Is AAC fire-resistant?</h3>
            <p>Yes, AAC is fire-resistant. It has a high fire resistance rating because it is made of non-combustible materials and can withstand high temperatures for extended periods.</p><br><br>

            <h3>Can AAC be used for both load-bearing and non-load-bearing walls?</h3>
            <p>Yes, AAC can be used for both load-bearing and non-load-bearing walls. It is commonly used for interior and exterior walls in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.</p><br><br>

            <h3>What is the density of AAC compared to conventional concrete?</h3>
            <p>AAC is much lighter than conventional concrete, with a density typically ranging from 400 to 800 kg/m³, compared to the typical density of normal concrete, which is about 2,400 kg/m³.</p><br><br>

            <h3>What are the environmental benefits of using AAC?</h3>
            <p>AAC is an environmentally friendly material because it uses non-toxic ingredients, reduces energy consumption in buildings due to its insulation properties, and has a lower carbon footprint during production compared to traditional concrete.</p><br><br>

            <h3>How is AAC finished or coated?</h3>
            <p>AAC surfaces can be finished with plaster, paint, or other coatings. The smooth surface of AAC allows for easy finishing, and it can also be directly applied with adhesives for tile or other wall finishes.</p><br><br>
